            If you’re looking for one of the best North Shore snorkeling beaches, look no further than Tunnels Beach-  a North Kauai gem that has a coral reef so massive it can be seen from space!<br><br>
            Tunnels is our favorite beach for snorkelling in all of the islands. There are never any crowds and there are so many amazing fish and wildlife.<br><br>
            If SCUBA diving is more your style, the amazing coral reef and generally calm conditions mean you, too, will have a spectacular dive. Be aware that there is a slight rip current, but most of the time it is rather weak.<br><br>
            The beach itself is located nearly directly across from mile marker 8 on Highway 560 going east from Hanalei towards Ha’ena, but we highly recommend you do NOT park on the street, as the police will ticket you for doing so.
