            We only recently discovered the Kuilau Ridge Trail, but it has quickly become one of our favorites!<br><br>
            The Kuilau Trail is a great walk for enjoying the many species of plant life on Kauai. Follow the old road that turns into a
            trail that leads you to amazing panoramas of Makaleha Mountains.<br><br>
            The beginning of the trail will introduce you to a variety of native and non-native plants. At about the one mile point you
            can take a break in a grassy field bordered by an Ohia forest, a picnic table and sweeping views of lush valleys and Mount Waialeale
            and the Makaleha Mountain Range.<br><br>
            The Kuilau Trail connects here to an east route that meets up with the Moalepe Trail. Further down the trail you will come to a
            wooden footbridge which crosses the Opaekaa Stream.<br><br>
            It takes a bit of effort to get to the trailhead, but it's totally worth it.<br><br>
