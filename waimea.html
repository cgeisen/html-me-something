            Waimea Canyon, on Kauai's West Side, is described as “The Grand Canyon of the Pacific.”<br><br>
            Although not as big or as old as its Arizona cousin, you won’t encounter anything like this geological wonder in Hawaii.<br><br>
            Stretching 14 miles long, 1 mile wide and more than 3,600 feet deep, the Waimea Canyon Lookout provides panoramic views of crested buttes, rugged crags and deep valley gorges.
            The grand inland vistas go on for miles.<br><br>
            The main road, Waimea Canyon Drive, leads you to a lower lookout point and the main Waimea Canyon Overlook, offering views of Kauai's dramatic interior.
             The road continues into the mountains and ends at Kokee State Park. There are numerous trails to traverse for beginners and seasoned hikers alike.<br><br>
             The moderate level Canyon Trail begins from a fork on the Cliff Trail and takes up to three hours to finish. Halfway into the hike, you will reach Waipo’o Falls,
             a gorgeous 800-foot waterfall that is perfect for a picnic spot. The end of the trail features the Kumuwela Lookout, a place where you can relax and revel in the beauty of the place you witnessed.

            The canyon is carved into the tholeiitic and post-shield calc-alkaline lavas of the canyon basalt. The lavas of the canyon provide evidence for massive faulting and
            collapse in the early history of the island. <br><br>
            The canyon has a unique geologic history as it was formed not only by the steady process of erosion but also by a catastrophic collapse of the volcano that created Kauaʻi.<br><br>
            Like the other Hawaiian islands, Kauaʻi is the top of an enormous volcano rising from the ocean floor. With lava flows dated to about 5 million years ago, Kauaʻi is the oldest
            of the large Hawaiian islands. Roughly 4 million years ago, while Kauaʻi was still erupting almost continuously, a portion of the island collapsed. This collapse formed a depression which
            then filled with lava flows.<br><br>
            In the time since, rainwater from the slopes of Mount Waiʻaleʻale have eroded Waimea Canyon along one edge of the collapse.
            On the east side of the canyon, the cliff walls are built from thick lava flows that pooled in the depression. Over time, the exposed basalt has weathered from its original black to bright red.
