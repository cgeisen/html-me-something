            My husband and I have been going to Hawaii since 2006. We got engaged there, we got married there and, as time goes on, we find ourselves staying for months at a time (mainly to escape the cold winters!). <br><br>Out of all the islands we've been to
            Kauai is by far our favorite. There are many reasons, but mainly because it's so laid back and friendly. Yes, there are lots of chickens everywhere on Kauai! Every day you awaken to the sound of the ocean mingled with the cock-a-doodle-do of a rooster.

            One of the other main reasons we love Hawaii is the amazing outdoors. We both love to hike and snorkel and play in the ocean.<br>
