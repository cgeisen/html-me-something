            If you only have time to go on one hike while you're visiting Kaua'i, this is the one!<br><br>
            The Kalalau Trail is an 11-mile trail that leads from Ke’e Beach to Kalalau Beach along the Nāpali Coast on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.<br><br>
            The Kalalau Trail is in the Nāpali Coast State Wilderness Park which is part of the Hawaii State Parks system.<br><br>
            The Kalalau Trail provides the only land access to this part of the rugged coast. The trail traverses 5 valleys before ending at Kalalau
            Beach where it is blocked by sheer, fluted pali.<br><br>
            The 11-mile trail is graded but almost never level as it crosses above towering sea cliffs and
            through lush valleys. The trail drops to sea level at the beaches of Hanakāpīʻai and Kalalau.<br><br>

            As you begin the trail, you'll traverse through a lush jungle-like scene of pothos and another philodendron.<br><br>
            The trail can be steep and rocky in places, but trust us - it's the climb you'll notice most.<br><br>
            Use extreme caution in any wet portions (granted, it's almost all wet along this stretch), and expect mud if it has rained recently.<br><br>
            After the first leg of the climb, at about half a mile, you emerge on a red dirt path that borders the cliffside overlooking the gorgeous
            NaPali Coast. Azure blue waters lie beneath you to the right overlooking Kee Beach below.
